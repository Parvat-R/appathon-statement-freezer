rmo gets all the memo
sends the memo

rmo checks if the memo are done or not

admin creates account - with memo creation ad escalation and responders

memo life cycle -> create (with tags for targets) -> notify rmo and the tags -> tags accepts or escalates -> complete (can be in pending also)

until memo is approved and completed it should not be closed memo.

not all the timeline

memo raisers, admin, approvers, responders

responder address, checks if he alone is suffecient
if yes  -> fixes it, completes the memo
if no, forwards the memo to other department by tagging them.
This goes on as recursion and traces back.

approver keeps
